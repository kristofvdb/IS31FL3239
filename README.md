# IS31FL3246
36-channel led driver from Lumissil

Simple Arduino library to configure and control the [IS31FL3246](https://www.mouser.cn/pdfDocs/IS31FL3246_DS.pdf) 36-channel led driver. The IS31FL3246 allows global R, G, and B current control for optimal white balance. The sketch demonstrates effects such as breathing mode, comet rings and color wheel rotation as well as software power up and down for power savings. This led driver is simple and easy to use; a worthy competitor to the LP5036.

I designed a 12-rgb-led ring to test this driver. The ring uses Lumex [LX0303](https://www.lumex.com/datasheet/SML-LX0303RGBC+1TR) rgb leds. The ring [design](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/E5gRvFSZ) is available in the shared space on OSH Park.
